Note:  @PrimaryKey: This specifies a list of comma-separated values to be treated as unique fields in the table. Each record in the table must have a unique combination of values for the fields specified here. @IndexBy: This specifies the fields that must be indexed at the database level. You can specify multiple values as a come-separated list. A single value to be in the format, ? FieldName   SortOrder   IndexOptions ? SortOrder  - ( 1) for Ascending and (-1) for Descending IndexOptions  - Index Options must be defined inside curly brackets. {} to be used for default options. Options must follow the standard mongodb index options format. Reference : https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.createIndex/ Example : ?symbol 1 {?unique?:true}?",
